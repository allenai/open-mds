If you are running the notebooks locally, make sure to add a virtual environment with this project installed in it to an IPython kernel:

```bash
pip install --user ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<myenv>
```

You can now select this environment as a kernel in the notebook. See [here](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/#add-virtual-environment-to-jupyter-notebook) for more details.

> **Note**
> some IDEs, like VSCode, will automate this process when you launch a notebook with the virtual environment active.

### üîé Open-domain MDS

In the paper, we bootstrap the newly proposed task of open-domain MDS using existing datasets, retrievers, and summarizers. To run these experiments, there are two steps:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ (OPTIONAL) Index and Retrieve the Input Documents

This is only required if you want to re-index the datasets and re-retrieve the input documents. We have already done this and made them publicly available. Just look for `"allenai/[dataset_name]_[sparse|dense]_[max|mean|oracle]"` on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets), e.g. [`"allenai/multinews_sparse_mean"`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/multinews_sparse_mean).

Otherwise, please use the [index_and_retrieve.py](./scripts/index_and_retrieve.py) script. First, make sure you have installed the required dependencies

```bash
# With pip
pip install "git+https://github.com/allenai/open-mds.git#egg=open_mds[retrieval]"

# OR, if installing with poetry
poetry install -E "retrieval"
```

Then you can see detailed instructions by calling

```bash
python ./scripts/index_and_retrieve.py --help
```

Here are a few examples:

Re-build the examples of the [Multi-News](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1102/) dataset with a `"sparse"` retriever and `"oracle"` top-`k` strategy

```bash
python ./scripts/index_and_retrieve.py "multinews" "./output/datasets/multinews_sparse_oracle" \
    --retriever "sparse" \
    --top-k-strategy "oracle"
```

Re-build the examples of the [MS^2](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.594/) dataset with a `"dense"` retriever and `"mean"` top-`k` strategy

```bash
python ./scripts/index_and_retrieve.py "ms2" "./output/datasets/ms2_dense_mean" \
    --retriever "dense" \
    --top-k-strategy "mean"
```

Other experiments can be crafted by modifying the arguments accordingly.

##### Notes

- If `index-path` is not provided, document indices will be saved to disk under a default location. You can get this path by calling

  ```bash
  python -c "from open_mds.common import util ; print(util.CACHE_DIR)"
  ```

- If you wish to use the `dense` retriever, you will need to install [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) with GPU support. See [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions.

#### Evaluate Summarizers in the Open-Domain Setting

Usage is similar to the original [`run_summarization.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/summarization/run_summarization.py) script from HuggingFace, but with extra arguments for the retrieval. To make things easier, [we provide configs](./conf) for the models and datasets we investigated. Here are a few examples:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate [PEGASUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08777) with a `"sparse"` retriever and `"mean"` top-`k` strategy on the [Multi-News](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1102/) dataset

```bash
python ./scripts/run_summarization.py "./conf/base.yml" "./conf/multinews/pegasus/eval.yml" \
    output_dir="./output/multinews/pegasus/retrieval/sparse/mean" \
    dataset_name="allenai/multinews_sparse_mean" \
    retriever="sparse" \
    top_k_strategy="mean"
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate [PRIMERA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08499) with a `"dense"` retriever and `"oracle"` top-`k` strategy on the [Multi-XScience](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.648/) dataset

```bash
python ./scripts/run_summarization.py "./conf/base.yml" "./conf/multixscience/primera/eval.yml" \
    output_dir="./output/multixscience/primera/retrieval/dense/oracle" \
    dataset_name="allenai/multixscience_dense_oracle" \
    retriever="dense" \
    top_k_strategy="oracle"
```

Other experiments can be crafted by modifying the arguments accordingly.

### üß™ Simulating Document Retrieval Errors

In the paper, we simulate document retrieval errors by perturbing the input document sets of several popular MDS datasets _before_ they are provided to the summarizer. Each of the perturbations is designed to mimic an error likely to be made by a __retriever__ in the open-domain setting:

- `"addition"`: Add one or more documents to the input to mimic the retrieval of irrelevant documents. 
- `"deletion"`: Remove one or more documents from the input to mimic the failure to retrieve relevant documents.
- `"duplication"`: Duplicate input documents to simulate the retrieval of duplicate (or near-duplicate) documents from the index.
- `"replacement"`: Replace one or more documents in the input with another document. This is a combination of `"addition"` and `"deletion"`.
- `"sorting"`: Sort (or shuffle) the order of input documents to simulate different rank-ordered lists from a retriever.
- `"backtranslation"`: Replace one or more documents in the input with a backtranslated copy. This is not an error a retriever would make, but allows us to compare and contrast the known sensitivity of NLP models to small token-level changes in their inputs with the document-level changes we are interested in.

We include two different document "selection strategies" that apply to each perturbation:

- `"random"`: Randomly selects documents for each perturbation. This mimics a (very) *weak* retriever.
- `"oracle"`: Attempts to select documents in a way that mimics a *strong* retriever. E.g. for `"deletion"`, documents _least similar_ to the target summary are removed first.

> Please see the paper for more details on the experimental setup.

Usage is similar to the original [`run_summarization.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/summarization/run_summarization.py) script from HuggingFace, but with extra arguments for the perturbation. To make things easier, [we provide configs](./conf) for the models and datasets we investigated. Here are a few examples:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate [PEGASUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08777) with the `"deletion"` perturbation and `"random"` document selection strategy, perturbing 10% of input documents on the [Multi-News](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1102/) dataset

```bash
python ./scripts/run_summarization.py "./conf/base.yml" "./conf/multinews/pegasus/eval.yml" \
    output_dir="./output/multinews/pegasus/perturbations/deletion/random/0.10" \
    perturbation="deletion" \
    selection_strategy="random" \
    perturbed_frac 0.10
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate [PRIMERA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08499) with the `"addition"` perturbation and `"oracle"` strategy, perturbing 50% of input documents on the [Multi-XScience](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.648/) dataset

```bash
python ./scripts/run_summarization.py "./conf/base.yml" "./conf/multixscience/primera/eval.yml" \
    output_dir="./output/multixscience/primera/perturbations/addition/oracle/0.50" \
    perturbation="addition" \
    selection_strategy="oracle" \
    perturbed_frac 0.50
```

Other experiments can be crafted by modifying the arguments accordingly.

#### Notes

- To avoid duplicate computation, some perturbations (like backtranslation) will cache their results. You can get this path by calling

  ```bash
  python -c "from open_mds.common import util ; print(util.CACHE_DIR)"
  ```
